# adbplus
This repo is for my "adbplus" project, which provides a number of simplifications/extensions to Android adb 

Version 1.0:
Added simplifications: 
1. ADB Push: No file directory parameter, just list file in current directory to push
2. ADB Pull: No file destination parameter, file will be placed in your current directory
